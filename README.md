# DamaToken Site

Marketing and claim portal for DamaToken.

## Features to wire
- Token story
- Claim walkthrough
- Roadmap milestones

## Project layout
- src/index.jsx: React entry with sample sections
- src/config.js: Product metadata and sample checklist
- .devcontainer/: Node 20 devcontainer for consistency
- package.json: placeholders for dev/build/lint/test (pick Vite/Next/Nx)

## Suggested next steps
1) Install your toolchain (Vite/Next) and replace the placeholder scripts.
2) Hook real data sources and routing.
3) Add lint/tests (eslint, vitest/jest) and CI in GitHub Actions.
